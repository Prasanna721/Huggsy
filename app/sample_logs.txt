# === Notes for Frontend Development ===
#
# 1. AI responses are streamed in chunks - you'll receive multiple ai_response
#    events for a single reply. Concatenate them or display progressively.
#
# 2. The emotion event typically comes before or at the start of AI response.
#    Common emotions: happy, neutral, sad, surprised, angry, thinking
#
# 3. user_speech arrives as a single complete message after ASR processing.
#
# 4. All messages are UTF-8 encoded. Chinese input is also supported:
#    {"event":"user_speech","message":"你好，今天天气怎么样？"}
#
# 5. Server should respond with: {"status":"ok"} (HTTP 200)
